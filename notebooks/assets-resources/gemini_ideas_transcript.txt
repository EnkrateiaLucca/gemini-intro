Google's Gemini 2.0 is making huge waves
0:02
in the AI world right now and some are
0:05
even calling it The Open AI killer and
0:07
honestly I don't think that's too
0:08
far-fetched right now given some of the
0:10
insane things that you can do with it
0:12
right now so today in this video I'm
0:13
going to share with you nine
0:14
mind-blowing use cases of Gemini 2.0 for
0:18
online businesses so the first thing to
0:19
know about Gemini 2.0 is that it's
0:21
completely free to use so if you go to
0:23
Google's AI Studio I'll link to it in
0:26
the description below but it's totally
0:28
free to use so when you go here you'll
0:30
see right on the screen that you can
0:32
start with a chat this is your normal AI
0:34
chat and in the upper right hand corner
0:37
if you go to the model dropdown you can
0:39
click on any of the models that uh
0:42
Google has released for Gemini at the
0:44
time recording this they've just
0:46
released this 2.0 flash thinking
0:49
experimental model great name right um
0:53
this is Ain to uh gpts 01 this is your
0:57
uh chain of reasoning your thought
0:59
process sort of model but we're gon to
1:01
be talking mostly today about the Gemini
1:02
2.0 flash experimental model and we're
1:05
going to go over to the stream real time
1:08
option in the upper leftand corner here
1:10
so you see in the screen multimo live
1:12
API with Gemini 2.0 this is where the
1:15
magic is happening right now with Gemini
1:18
2.0 and this is what we're going to dive
1:20
into right now as you can see here you
1:22
can talk to Gemini you can show Gemini
1:24
so if you have a webcam on your computer
1:27
or you can also access this on your
1:30
phone by the way so you can use your
1:32
your uh phone camera and show Gemini
1:35
things and it will describe it you can
1:37
ask questions about what you're looking
1:38
at it's really really cool we're going
1:40
to be looking at a lot today with the
1:43
share your screen option and we're going
1:45
to be able to talk to Gemini based on
1:48
what we're looking at on the computer
1:51
screen so let's start doing that so
1:52
we're going to click on share your
1:54
screen and we get to choose which screen
1:56
that we want to share you can see in the
1:57
bottom left hand corner the the red uh
2:00
buttons here microphone obviously allows
2:02
you to talk and the camera is the screen
2:05
sharing part so I'm going to share my
2:07
main screen
2:09
here and I'm going to open up a sample
2:14
p&l so for this first use case we're
2:16
going to use Gemini 2.0 to analyze a
2:20
profit and loss statement from your
2:22
online business so what we're looking at
2:23
here today is a sample profit and loss
2:27
and so what I'm gonna I'm going to do is
2:28
I'm gonna ask Google here to analyze
2:32
this p&l to discuss uh identify Trends
2:37
with it see if it can share with me what
2:39
the profit margin percentage is and then
2:42
also how to increase the profit margin
2:45
so hey Google we're looking at a profit
2:47
and loss statement of an online business
2:49
right now can you see that sure the
2:51
video shows a spreadsheet with a profit
2:52
and loss statement the speaker mentions
2:54
using Gemini 2.0 to analyze the
2:57
information and identify trends they
3:00
would also like to know the profit
3:02
margin percentage and how to increase it
3:04
is there anything else you would like to
3:06
know or explore regarding this profit
3:08
and loss statement yeah I want you to
3:10
take a look at this p&l and number one
3:12
tell me what the uh profit margin
3:14
percentage is okay I see that you would
3:17
like to know the profit margin
3:19
percentage from the P and L the net
3:21
profit is $199,300 and the revenue is
3:26
$75,000 meaning the profit margin
3:28
percentage is 25
3:30
7% would you like to explore further
3:32
regarding this yeah can you tell me how
3:34
I can increase that profit margin based
3:36
on what you're looking at in the profit
3:38
and loss statement I want you to
3:40
prioritize the top three things that we
3:43
could do to increase that profit margin
3:46
certainly based on the profit and loss
3:47
statement here are the top three things
3:49
you could prioritize to increase your
3:51
profit margin first you could increase
3:53
product sales which is currently the
3:54
highest revenue driver at
3:56
$60,000 second you could reduce cost of
3:59
goods sold as that has the highest spend
4:01
at
4:02
$25,000 lastly you could decrease wages
4:05
which currently is
4:06
$115,000 do you want me to elaborate on
4:08
these or explore other ways to increase
4:10
profit margin now this is great thanks
4:13
you're welcome let me know if you have
4:14
any more questions all right so now I'm
4:16
back in the AI Studio here and you can
4:18
see the conversations that we're going
4:20
back and forth now over in the right
4:22
hand column here you can choose the
4:24
output format obviously I was choosing
4:26
audio to be able to speak to the AI I
4:30
can also choose text and what that does
4:33
is it types out what the conversation is
4:36
and what Google is saying I don't I I
4:40
like the option of text because I get to
4:42
see what it's being what's being said on
4:44
the screen but it's not as easy to have
4:47
a back and forth conversation um with
4:49
the AI model so if you want to see what
4:53
is being said during the conversation
4:56
you will have to go and click the three
4:59
little dots next to the audio file here
5:03
and click on download and then you can
5:04
go over to like notebook LM or uh
5:08
riverside. FM transcription and have it
5:12
transcribed that that part is a little
5:14
bit of a pain in the butt but I prefer
5:17
the audio back and forth because I can
5:19
again you can have a conversation with
5:21
it and then you can go back if you want
5:23
to and and get the transcript of the
5:26
files it's not ideal right now but I
5:29
really like the ability to talk back and
5:31
forth with the AI by the way if you like
5:33
this type of information and you're an
5:35
online business and you're looking to
5:36
learn more about how to leverage AI in
5:38
your business so that you can work a
5:40
whole lot less in the business and
5:42
increase profit while you're doing that
5:44
I want to invite you to join me in our
5:46
school Community called the AI Playbook
5:48
premium Community as you can see here on
5:50
the screen it's an amazing community
5:53
that uh we're just talking AI all day
5:55
every day this is a place for you to ask
5:57
questions and connect with other
5:58
like-minded online online businesses we
6:00
have weekly calls classroom with all
6:03
kinds of uh workshops and lessons and
6:06
courses and stuff like that here want to
6:08
invite you to join us inside the AI
6:10
Playbook community and I will link to it
6:12
in the description below for this next
6:14
use case speaking of improving business
6:16
performance using Gemini 2.0 and the
6:19
screen sharing option is an awesome way
6:21
to analyze your ad campaign stat so if
6:24
you're running any kind of ads whether
6:26
it be meta ads or Google ads sometimes
6:28
it's kind of difficult to look at the
6:30
stats and make sense of what's going on
6:32
well you can use Gemini 2.0 in sharing
6:35
the screen option to optimize your ad
6:38
campaigns let me show you what I'm
6:39
talking about here yeah so Google what
6:40
you're looking at here is a meta ads
6:43
report and what I want to do is I want
6:46
you to help me figure out where we are
6:50
underperforming I want you to suggest
6:53
ways to increase return on ad spend and
6:56
get more for our ad dollar certainly
6:58
you're showing me a meta ads report
7:00
spreadsheet and you want me to help you
7:01
figure out where you are underperforming
7:03
you would also like me to suggest ways
7:05
to increase return on ad spend and get
7:07
more for your ad dollar is that correct
7:09
yeah that's right okay I understand I'll
7:12
take a look at the data to identify
7:13
areas of underperformance and suggest
7:16
ways to improve your return on ad spend
7:18
okay go ahead okay looking at the
7:20
spreadsheet it seems like the return on
7:22
ad spend or
7:23
Ras is pretty varied ranging from 1.5 to
7:27
5.5 I see that some days have a lower r
7:31
o a s for example December 16th and 17th
7:36
both show a Ras under two which seems to
7:40
be an area that is underperforming
7:42
compared to days like December 2nd where
7:44
the r was
7:46
5.5 do you want to dig in deeper on any
7:49
of these
7:50
dates yeah I want you to tell me how we
7:52
can increase the overall Ras for this
7:56
campaign and reduce wasted ad spend okay
7:59
you want to increase the overall roas
8:01
for this campaign and reduce wasted ad
8:04
spend there are a few ways we could try
8:05
to do this first I would suggest we look
8:08
at your cost per lead for instance the
8:10
cost per lead on December 16th was
8:13
$5.88 which appears to be the highest in
8:15
your data all right so as you can see
8:17
here one of the annoying things about it
8:19
which I also understand what the AI is
8:21
doing but it always wants to confirm
8:23
with you what you're asking for which I
8:25
get it's just a little bit annoying
8:27
because it kind of slows things down
8:29
but it was analyzing that spreadsheet
8:32
and starting to give me suggestions on
8:34
how to improve uh return on ad spend and
8:37
reduce wasted ad budget which I think is
8:39
super cool and a great use case for Us
8:42
online businesses for this next use case
8:44
we're going to use Gemini 2.0 and the
8:46
screen sharing feature to analyze our
8:49
presentation so whether you're giving a
8:51
webinar a sales pitch or a talk in front
8:54
of a group of people you can have it
8:56
analyzed while you practice your
8:58
presentation with it and it'll give you
9:01
feedback in real time about the
9:04
presentation and how you're delivering
9:05
it let's check this out so again we go
9:07
over to share your screen we're going to
9:09
pick the screen and this time we're
9:10
going to choose my keynote slides hey
9:12
Google so this is a present sounds like
9:14
you're going to be sharing your keynote
9:15
slides is there anything you'd like to
9:17
do with them yeah I want you to analyze
9:20
the delivery of giving this presentation
9:23
and also give me some feedback on uh the
9:27
delivery and the clarity of message can
9:29
you do that sure I can analyze the
9:31
delivery of your presentation and
9:33
provide feedback on both the delivery
9:35
and Clarity of the message I'll take a
9:37
look at the slides and give you my
9:38
thoughts all right cool first before I
9:39
begin do you have any questions for me
9:41
that you need to know about in order to
9:42
do this task with me thanks that's a
9:44
good question do you want me to focus on
9:46
any specific aspects of the presentation
9:48
delivery like pacing tone or transitions
9:52
also is there any particular message
9:54
within the presentation that you are
9:55
most concerned about in terms of
9:58
clarity yeah I want to make sure that I
10:00
am motivating the people that I'm giving
10:02
this presentation to that they can use
10:05
AI in their online business even if they
10:09
are non techsavvy or maybe a little
10:11
afraid of using AI okay it sounds like
10:13
you want to make sure that your audience
10:15
feels empowered and motivated to use AI
10:17
in their online businesses even if
10:19
they're not tech-savvy or are a bit
10:21
hesitant about it I will keep that in
10:23
mind as I analyze your presentation all
10:25
right cool so on the first slide here I
10:26
talk about AI myths and sharing the the
10:29
fact that they do not need to be
10:30
techsavvy or no coding to use AI they
10:34
often think that AI tools are too
10:35
complicated uh that they're going to be
10:37
wasting time trying to figure it out and
10:39
it's just that one more thing to learn
10:43
but then I go right into why AI matters
10:46
for online businesses it's going to help
10:47
you reduce time you can delegate
10:49
repetitive tasks thus helping you scale
10:52
your business by doing these things it's
10:54
going to free up your time as the CEO of
10:56
your business to be able to work on the
10:58
higher impact things and The highed
11:00
Leverage activities and AI by the way is
11:03
no longer a nice to know at this point
11:05
it is a must no okay so on the first
11:09
slide you're addressing some common
11:10
myths about Ai and then the second slide
11:13
is about why AI matters for online
11:15
businesses mentioning that it can help
11:17
reduce time delegate tasks and scale a
11:19
business it's good that you're
11:21
addressing potential hesitations and
11:23
following it up with the benefits any
11:25
feedback that you would change there
11:27
slides are clear and well organized with
11:29
a good contrast between the text and
11:31
background to make it even more
11:33
impactful you could consider using
11:35
slightly larger fonts for the main
11:37
points on the why AI matters for you
11:39
slide and also perhaps use a more
11:41
Dynamic image background instead of a
11:43
solid color on the AI myth slide to
11:45
increase engagement I think that's super
11:47
cool that you can leverage this to
11:49
practice your presentations to get
11:51
feedback on the delivery the content the
11:55
messaging the design anything you want
11:57
to know about the slides you can be
11:58
Leverage leveraging the new Gemini 2.0
12:01
in order to do that now while we're on
12:03
the topic of leveraging Gemini 2.0 to
12:06
give you feedback I make a lot of
12:07
automations in make.com so we're often
12:11
coming across a lot of error messages
12:13
Within These scenarios that I'm building
12:16
well leveraging the screen sharing
12:18
option in Gemini 2.0 in order to
12:21
troubleshoot these issues is an amazing
12:23
use case for this technology let's check
12:26
it out so again we're clicking screen
12:27
share and we'll go over to make okay I
12:30
will go over to you is there anything
12:32
else I can help you with yeah Google so
12:34
we're looking at an automation that I've
12:35
built in make.com and I'm getting an
12:38
error message whenever I try to run the
12:41
automation can you help troubleshoot it
12:43
I'm going to go ahead and click run
12:44
right now and you should see an error
12:46
message up on the screen can you help me
12:49
with this sure I can help you with that
12:51
it looks like you're using make.com to
12:53
create an Automation and are getting an
12:55
error message when you try to run it I
12:57
see the Run button on the bottom left so
12:59
when you click on that you'll be able to
13:00
show me what happens yeah exactly so let
13:02
me do that again for you okay I'm ready
13:04
to see it please run the automation
13:06
again all right there it is okay I see
13:08
the error message at the bottom right of
13:09
the screen it says cannot read
13:11
properties of null reading device do you
13:14
know what this means no that's why I'm
13:16
asking you can you help me resolve this
13:18
issue okay I understand the error
13:21
message cannot read properties of null
13:23
reading device suggests that the
13:25
automation is trying to access a
13:27
property called device of a very
13:29
variable that is currently null or
13:30
undefined could you tell me a bit more
13:33
about what the automation is supposed to
13:35
do this would help me understand where
13:36
the device property should be defined
13:38
well first thing to know is that as soon
13:41
as I click run the error message pops up
13:44
so let's assume that it's in the first
13:45
step here okay that's helpful so the
13:48
error occurs right after you click run
13:50
which suggests that the issue might be
13:52
in the initial steps of your automation
13:55
the first step you have is the cloud
13:57
convert module is that correct
13:59
yes as you can see on the screen okay
14:01
thanks let's investigate the cloud
14:03
convert module then could you open up
14:06
its configuration settings by clicking
14:08
on it I'm curious to see what input
14:10
parameters are set up for that okay I
14:12
see the configuration settings for the
14:14
cloud convert module it looks like it's
14:15
asking you to create a web Hook is that
14:18
something you expected yeah that's right
14:20
just can you just tell me how to resolve
14:21
this issue okay it seems the issue is
14:24
that the cloud convert module requires a
14:26
web hook to be set up but it hasn't been
14:28
configured yet to resolve this you'll
14:30
need to create a web hook do you want to
14:32
do that now yeah let's do it okay to
14:34
create a web hook click the create a web
14:37
hook button inside the cloud convert
14:38
module once it is created the error
14:41
message should not appear so if you're
14:43
building any kind of automations using
14:45
make.com or zapier by the way we make a
14:48
ton of done for you automations for the
14:50
members of my AI Playbook premium School
14:53
Community again I'll link to it in the
14:55
description below but if you're doing
14:57
any kind of automation building in these
15:00
tools and you get a lot of errors that
15:02
don't necessarily make sense to you you
15:04
can leverage the screen sharing
15:07
technology here in Gemini 2.0 to help
15:09
troubleshoot these errors especially
15:11
when you get an error message you're
15:12
like I have no idea what this means you
15:13
can simply ask Google and it will help
15:16
walk you through it and troubleshoot it
15:18
with you for this next use case if
15:19
you're anything like me you often have
15:21
30 40 50 tabs open on your screen and if
15:24
you struggle with ADHD at all like I do
15:29
this is going to be a huge help for you
15:32
leveraging 2.0 and the screen sharing
15:34
capabilities to help you organize what
15:36
you've got going on on your screen and
15:38
to help you work through setting up your
15:41
priorities based on what you're looking
15:43
at on the screen with all the tabs open
15:45
check this out hey Google we're looking
15:46
at a whole bunch of tabs I have open on
15:49
my window here there's several
15:51
half-finished tasks and I'm feeling
15:53
really stuck can you help me make sense
15:55
of all this and figure out where to even
15:57
start sure I can help with that it
15:59
sounds like you have a lot of open tabs
16:01
and tasks and that you're feeling stuck
16:04
I will do my best to help you make sense
16:05
of it all and figure out where to start
16:08
do you want to start with the tabs or
16:09
the tasks where do you think we should
16:12
start I'm really overwhelmed with
16:14
everything I've got going on in the
16:15
screen okay it sounds like you're
16:16
feeling overwhelmed so let's tackle This
16:18
Together perhaps we can start by
16:20
focusing on one thing at a time would it
16:23
be helpful to begin by looking at the
16:24
open tabs or the list of tasks yeah
16:27
let's start with the open tabs all right
16:29
let's start with the open tabs could you
16:31
tell me which tabs you have open I see
16:32
some on the left side of the screen and
16:34
it looks like you have a stream realtime
16:36
tab open too yeah exactly what you're
16:38
looking at these the tabs that are open
16:40
are currently open right now which is
16:42
adding to the overwhelm and um I need
16:46
just some clearer focus and a structured
16:48
approach to tackling this overwhelm okay
16:52
it sounds like you're looking for a more
16:54
focused and structured approach to
16:55
tackling the overwhelm the tabs you have
16:58
open on the left are Google AI Studio to
17:01
read watch bookmarked working on now
17:04
zapier ai actions plus gpts so this is
17:07
another cool use case leveraging Gemini
17:09
2.0 in the screen sharing if you're have
17:11
all these tabs open and you've got half
17:13
done tasks and everything like that you
17:15
can leverage it to look at your screen
17:18
and help you organize things and make
17:19
sense of it and reduce that overwhelm
17:22
speaking of getting help with technology
17:24
Gemini 2.0 and the screen sharing can
17:26
really help you understand software or
17:28
tools or websites that you don't really
17:31
know what you're doing on that site so
17:33
I'm going to use repet as an example
17:35
because even though repet is super easy
17:37
to use in terms of what it can do for
17:39
you navigating repet is not my strong
17:42
suit so we're going to test out Gemini
17:44
2.0 and help me walk through repet and
17:47
how to build a tool using repet hey
17:49
Google what we're looking at here is the
17:52
repet website and I'm not really sure
17:55
how to use this site I'm pretty new to
17:57
it so I'm sharing my screen now can you
17:59
help me understand how to use repet in
18:03
building something that I've always been
18:05
thinking about for the business sure I
18:08
can help you with that replit is a
18:10
platform that allows you to write and
18:11
run code in your browser and it offers
18:13
many options for different kinds of
18:14
projects you might want to build to get
18:16
started you'll need to provide a
18:17
description of what you want to build in
18:19
the text box labeled describe an app or
18:21
site you want to create and then click
18:23
the button labeled start building can
18:25
you give me some more information on
18:27
what your goal is with rep yeah I want
18:29
to build an app for it's a special
18:32
onboarding app for my online membership
18:35
so that I can personalize the onboarding
18:37
experience is there a template that
18:40
repet has that I can use to get started
18:42
with this okay it sounds like you want
18:44
to build an onboarding app for your
18:46
online membership using repet and you're
18:48
wondering if there's a template you can
18:49
use to get started repet has many
18:51
templates for many purposes if you click
18:53
choose a template at the top of the page
18:55
it will display them do you see any that
18:57
might be a good fit for you or do you
19:00
want to provide some further details
19:02
about your project so that I can give
19:03
some
19:04
suggestions so I have no idea I know
19:07
that these are coding languages I have
19:10
no idea though what any of these mean in
19:12
terms of templates so maybe it's not the
19:15
best strategy for Me Maybe it's going
19:17
back here to the uh create with repet
19:20
agent you're right the template options
19:22
may not be the best fit for you at this
19:23
stage it looks like the create with
19:25
repet agent option is a good alternative
19:28
to explore
19:29
with that option you will describe what
19:30
you want to create in the text box and
19:32
replit will generate something based on
19:34
that description do you want me to
19:35
explain how the repl agent works or do
19:37
you just want to get started so by
19:39
sharing your screen with the software
19:41
that you're trying to figure out how to
19:42
use Gemini 2.0 can walk you through and
19:45
give you guidance on what steps that you
19:47
need to be taking in order to use the
19:50
software I mean how cool is that and
19:52
this kind of guidance isn't just for
19:53
software it can help you with your
19:56
website design too or landing pages so I
19:58
pulled up my website here and I want
20:01
Gemini 2.0 to analyze this uh website
20:05
for design for copy for flow Etc and
20:10
give me feedback on what changes I can
20:12
make to make it better hey Google what
20:14
what you're looking at here is my
20:16
website can you give me feedback on
20:19
usability design overall message
20:22
starting with the homepage and working
20:24
through the site structure sure I can do
20:27
that the website you're showing has a
20:28
man with his arms outstretched on the
20:30
right and text in the center that reads
20:32
I teach online businesses how to use AI
20:34
to work less and profit more with
20:36
additional text beneath that the page
20:39
also has a navigation menu on the top do
20:41
you want me to go deeper into the site
20:44
structure can you start with the design
20:48
what do you think about the design I
20:49
want to make this as super simple and a
20:52
clean UI as possible okay I see what
20:56
you're asking the website design is
20:57
pretty simple with a limited number of
20:59
colors and the text is easy to read the
21:02
layout is also very straightforward so
21:04
it seems like it could achieve that
21:06
Simple and Clean user interface you're
21:07
looking for is there anything about the
21:09
design in particular you'd like me to
21:11
focus on well I want you to tell me what
21:13
can be
21:15
improved okay I understand one thing
21:18
that could be improved is the color
21:20
contrast between the text and the
21:21
background while it's readable
21:23
increasing the contrast would make it
21:25
even easier to see additionally the IM
21:28
of the person could so because I'm not
21:30
an expert in usability or UI design or
21:33
anything like that I can leverage the
21:35
technology to show my website and go
21:38
through every single page on the site or
21:40
landing pages and have Gemini 2.0 give
21:43
me feedback on the design usability
21:46
messaging the flow of the pages Etc to
21:49
suggest the changes that I should be
21:51
making to it before I shared the last
21:53
two use cases you might be wondering
21:55
well yeah you can do a lot of these
21:56
things with chachy BT because they just
21:58
rolled out screen sharing and the
22:01
ability to do something similar to what
22:03
I'm showing you here with Gemini 2.0 in
22:05
fact open AI announced it like a day
22:07
after Gemini 2.0 was released which I
22:10
find interesting so yes you can do a lot
22:13
of the same things that we're doing here
22:15
today with Gemini 2.0 over with Chachi
22:18
BT and the screen sharing option and
22:21
using the advanced voice mode however
22:24
you are limited to the number of
22:25
interactions that you can have with it
22:27
per day whereas here with Gemini 2.0 and
22:31
you get like 1,500 requests per day with
22:33
Gemini 2.0 along with a million token
22:37
context window so that alone is a huge
22:39
differentiator with Gemini 2.0 and not
22:42
to mention it's totally free to use
22:44
Gemini 2.0 in the Google AI studio so
22:47
it's free to use and it's super super
22:50
fast now for this next use case let's
22:51
zoom out a little bit and look at our
22:53
business a little bit more holistically
22:55
and look at how the business operates so
22:57
we can use the screen sharing
22:58
functionality within 2.0 to look at the
23:02
bottlenecks within our workflow so what
23:04
I'm going to do with it is I'm going to
23:05
screen share my notion dashboard and ask
23:08
it for recommendations on how to improve
23:10
my workflows and how I have my project
23:13
set up Etc hey Google what you're
23:14
looking at here is my notion dashboard
23:19
and so what I want you to do is analyze
23:21
what you're seeing and tell me and
23:24
propose some possible improvements for
23:27
workflow
23:28
how do I simplify this are there easier
23:31
ways to display what I'm uh currently uh
23:36
showing you I go by the par method so
23:39
projects areas resources and archives so
23:43
if you can take a look at what I'm
23:44
showing you and give me your suggestions
23:45
for improving the workflows that I've
23:48
set up here sure you've got a notion
23:50
dashboard here named Rick HQ with a task
23:52
tracker it has several tasks listed with
23:55
different priorities deadlines statuses
23:58
notes and areas you want me to analyze
24:01
it and propose improvements to your
24:02
workflow and suggest easier ways to
24:04
display this information additionally I
24:07
see that you use the pay method which
24:10
includes projects areas resources and
24:13
archives do you want me to focus on
24:15
something
24:16
specific not necessarily I want you to
24:18
look at the overall how I have set up
24:21
the dashboard here and give me your
24:23
suggestions for improving the the
24:26
workflow that I have set up okay I
24:29
understand you'd like me to analyze the
24:31
overall setup of your notion dashboard
24:33
and give you suggestions for improving
24:34
your workflow I can definitely do that
24:37
let's start with the layout of your
24:38
dashboard the task tracker seems to be
24:40
in the center with favorites on the left
24:43
and images at the bottom do you find the
24:45
layout to be efficient yeah I think so
24:47
but I'd like to hear what you have to
24:49
say about it okay since you are happy
24:51
with the layout let's focus on the task
24:53
tracker itself it has columns for task
24:56
name priority deadline status notes and
24:59
area this setup is quite detailed would
25:02
you find it helpful to use a board view
25:04
to see these tasks categorized by status
25:07
such as too in progress and done yeah I
25:11
have a board view which is right here so
25:15
I already have that all right since you
25:17
already have a board view let's explore
25:19
other possible improvements looking at
25:21
the columns in your table view I see you
25:23
have a notes column that sometimes
25:25
contains external links would it be Ed
25:28
useful to separate the external links
25:30
into a dedicated links column that way
25:33
you could click on links directly rather
25:35
than having to go into the but do you
25:37
have any bigger suggestions for me so
25:39
obviously this will work with any tool
25:41
that you are using any project
25:43
management tool or maybe you've got
25:45
workflow diagrams that uh you've made
25:47
you can have the AI look at it and
25:50
identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
25:53
and suggestions for improvements just
25:55
like it just did with my notion
25:58
dashboard and I'm absolutely going to be
26:00
implementing uh the suggestions that uh
26:02
it's making and then finally when you're
26:03
ready to bring your team together for
26:05
planning you can use the AI and the
26:08
screen sharing option in Gemini 2.0 to
26:11
share with it your brainstorming your
26:13
digital whiteboard or your planning tool
26:16
and have it make suggestions to you for
26:18
making improvements filling in the gaps
26:20
coming up with ideas basically making
26:23
sense of your brain dump of ideas on
26:26
your screen so let's do that right now
26:28
hey Google I'm sharing with you a
26:30
brainstorming board for a team project
26:32
where we're going to be doing an
26:34
okr Workshop can you sort of look at
26:37
what I've put together so far and the
26:39
team has put together for summarizing
26:41
the ideas that we've got there
26:43
identifying any missing gaps and
26:45
potentially helping us organize what we
26:47
can be doing better with this board sure
26:50
you're sharing a brainstorming board for
26:51
a team project okay it seems that you
26:54
would like me to help you summarize the
26:55
ideas identify any gaps and help
26:58
organize what you can do better with
27:00
this board is that right yes okay I'll
27:03
do my best to help you to start could
27:05
you tell me more about the project and
27:07
what your team is hoping to achieve with
27:09
this Workshop yeah we want to be rolling
27:11
out okrs so objectives and key results
27:14
to the rest of the organization so we're
27:16
putting together a workshop to deliver
27:19
to the rest of the organization and we
27:21
are planning that right now with what
27:23
you're seeing on the screen thanks so it
27:25
sounds like you're creating a workshop
27:26
to roll out okr s which are objectives
27:29
and key results to the rest of your
27:31
organization it seems like you are using
27:34
this whiteboard to plan out that
27:35
Workshop right yep okay I see it looks
27:39
like you've got a good start with the
27:40
different sections would you like me to
27:42
start by summarizing the ideas currently
27:44
on the
27:45
board no let's go right into how you
27:47
would improve this okay so you would
27:50
like to skip the summary and instead get
27:52
my recommendations on how to improve the
27:55
workshop plan on this board is that
27:57
correct yes yes okay I can do that I
28:00
noticed that you have sections for
28:01
objectives and key results have you
28:03
considered adding a section for
28:05
initiatives this would be where you list
28:07
out the specific projects or actions
28:09
that will help achieve those key results
28:11
so again another super powerful use case
28:14
when you are have a whole bunch of
28:16
random ideas on your screen that you
28:18
want to get organized you can use the AI
28:20
to walk you through its suggestions for
28:23
making improvements and better
28:24
organizing your ideas and filling in the
28:26
gaps of things that you might be missing
28:27
now before I wrap up I want to show you
28:29
one more thing inside the studio so if
28:32
we go back to the main screen if you
28:34
will here in the Google AI Studio you'll
28:37
notice number one that when you click
28:39
the drop down you do have access to all
28:42
the different Gemini models when you go
28:44
over to the stream real time which we
28:46
did and then also one of the new
28:47
features here in Gemini
28:49
2.0 if you want to be searching the
28:51
internet for example and you want to get
28:53
sources included in your search results
28:56
just come over here to the right hand
28:57
side here and turn on grounding you can
28:59
see here Source Google search so
29:01
whatever I search for in here is going
29:04
to search just as if Google would and
29:07
also it's going be super super fast by
29:09
the way and it'll give you the search
29:11
results with the sources linking out to
29:15
wherever the information is coming from
29:18
so as you can see here Google is back
29:20
they are so back and I'm really excited
29:22
about how quickly Google is rolling out
29:25
these things and really excited about
29:27
the possibilities that Gemini 2.0 brings
29:29
with the agentic features that are going
29:32
to be coming out in 2025 really really
29:34
excited for all of that again if you're
29:35
an online business and you're looking to
29:37
leverage AI to work a whole lot less and
29:40
increase your profit then I want invite
29:42
you to start a 7-Day free trial over in
29:44
my school Community called the AI
29:47
Playbook premium again I'll link to it
29:48
in the description below thanks so much
29:50
for watching and I'll see you in the
29:52
next video
